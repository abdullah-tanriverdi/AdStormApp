### PHONE CONTROL WITH APK

The Android APK I developed within Eterna Technology can perform various operations on rooted Android devices in line with the requests from the server. This application provides a reliable server connection using Socket.io and executes transactions over an efficient communication protocol. I took advantage of Android's Accessibility Service and Broadcast mechanisms so that the APK can run automatically as soon as it is installed. In this way, I developed a custom Android Service to ensure that the application remains constantly active in the background without user interaction. In the design of the project, I created a structured and scalable structure, taking into account software architectures and best practices. This architectural approach has facilitated the performance and maintenance of the application by providing a dynamic and reliable solution.
